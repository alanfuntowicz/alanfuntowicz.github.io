Welcome! I am a MSc student in Economics at [University of SÃ£o Paulo](https://www.fea.usp.br/en/economia/graduate-studies) and a Research Assistant at [CERP - Religion and Public Policy](https://sites.usp.br/cerp/). Currently, I am studying ideology in Brazilian deputies' speeches using text as data. My research interests include political economy, applied microeconomics, microeconometrics and machine learning techniques.
