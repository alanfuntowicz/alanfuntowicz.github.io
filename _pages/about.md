Welcome! I am a MSc student in Economics at the [University of SÃ£o Paulo](https://www.fea.usp.br/en/economia/graduate-studies) and a Research Assistant at [CERP - Religion and Public Policy](https://sites.usp.br/cerp/). Currently, I am studying rhetoric in the speeches of Brazilian politicians, using textual data. I work as a Research Assistant at the World Bank, specifically within the Development Impact Evaluation (DIME) unit. My research interests lie in the field of Applied Microeconomics, with a special focus on Political and Public Economics, Labor, Education, and Health. Additionally, I have an interest in Industrial Organization (IO) methods and machine learning techniques.
